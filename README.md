# android-custom-surface-view-camera
An android app for testing a face change api with a custom SurfaceView for a legacy Camera object.
The Face Change API is a ML api implemented by cpury (https://github.com/cpury) where given an image with a face, it returns
female-fied or male-fied version.

I used the legacy camera to test out the problem I was having on another app with backward compatibility.
